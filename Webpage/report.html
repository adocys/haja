    <h1 style="color: white;">Bike Lane Project Report</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">This report outlines the feasibility of the proposed bike lane project, including analysis of costs, benefits, and potential risks.</p>

    <h2 style="color: white;">1. Introduction</h2>
    <p style="color: white;">The purpose of this report is to evaluate the viability of the bike lane project and provide recommendations based on the findings.</p>

    <h2 style="color: white;">2. Project Overview</h2>
    <img src="asset/graph.jpeg" alt="Line Graph" class="project-image">
    <p style="color: white;">Details about the bike lane project, including objectives, scope, and expected outcomes.</p>

    <h2 style="color: white;">3. Cost Analysis</h2>
    <img src="asset/linegraph.png" alt="Line Graph" class="project-image" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
    <p style="color: white;">An analysis of the estimated costs associated with the bike lane project.</p>

    <h2 style="color: white;">4. Benefits</h2>
    <p style="color: white;">
        The proposed bike lane project offers numerous benefits that can significantly enhance the urban environment and promote sustainable transportation. 
        Firstly, it will improve cyclist safety by providing a dedicated space for biking, reducing the risk of accidents with motor vehicles. 
        This separation encourages more people to consider cycling as a viable mode of transportation, leading to increased ridership.
    </p>
    <p style="color: white;">
        Additionally, the bike lane will contribute to reduced traffic congestion, as more individuals opt for cycling instead of driving. 
        This shift not only alleviates pressure on roadways but also decreases greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to a cleaner environment. 
        Furthermore, the presence of bike lanes can enhance local businesses by increasing foot traffic and attracting customers who prefer to cycle.
    </p>
    <p style="color: white;">
        The project also promotes a healthier lifestyle by encouraging physical activity among residents. 
        With improved infrastructure, cycling becomes a more accessible and appealing option for commuting, recreation, and exercise, ultimately leading to better public health outcomes.
    </p>
    <p style="color: white;">
        Moreover, the bike lane can enhance the overall quality of life in the community by providing safe and enjoyable spaces for recreation, fostering a sense of community, and encouraging social interactions among residents.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: white;">5. Risks</h2>
    <p style="color: white;">
        While the bike lane project presents numerous benefits, it is essential to consider potential risks. 
        These include the initial costs of construction and ongoing maintenance, which may strain local budgets. 
        Additionally, there may be resistance from some community members or drivers who are concerned about changes to traffic patterns. 
        To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to conduct thorough community outreach and education to ensure all stakeholders understand the benefits and safety measures associated with the bike lane.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: white;">6. Conclusion</h2>
    <p style="color: white;">Summary of findings and final recommendations for the bike lane project.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">
        It is recommended to proceed with the bike lane project, as it promises significant benefits in terms of safety, environmental impact, and community well-being. 
        Engaging stakeholders and ensuring public awareness will be crucial for successful implementation and long-term sustainability.
